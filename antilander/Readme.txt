STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are Earth's last line of defense against the evil Reticlians, an alien 
race bent on occupying and enslaving all of Earth. You must travel through 
fifty of Earths most crucial sectors to fight for your very life!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE HERO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your heavy weapons platform travels all around the world fending off 
landers wherever you are needed. Shoot as many landers as you can.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ENEMY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landers! Legions of them. They will not stop until they have conquered all of 
Earth. Don't let them land or they will become indestructible. If 
too many of them land, they will overrun your platform, and you are doomed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAMEPLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move the mouse to indicate where you want to fire, using the crosshair 
reticle.

Left Click  -- Fire Missile
	Note that it takes time for your missile to reach its target, so aim 
	below it.

Right Click -- Fire Bomb
	The bomb arcs, which is good for hitting enemys behind mountains. 
	Note that your bomb will fire faster the further away your reticle is 
	from your gunship.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Menu automatically pops up when the game first starts. While in menu, 
pressing the "N" key or clicking on "New" will begin a new game. Pressing 
the "Q" key or clicking on "Quit" will exit out of the game. The menu can 
also be accessed during the game by hitting the "Esc" key. You can then hit 
"Esc" again to resume your current game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMMUNITION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
While you are playing, on the top of the screen is the Heads-Up Display (HUD),
which gives information about the level you are playing. Starting on the 
left is the missile symbol followed by a number, which indicates the number 
of missiles you have left on that level. Next to the missile number is a bomb 
symbol followed by another number, which indicates the number of bombs you 
have left. The amount of ammo you start with changes from level to level. 
Some levels limit your ammo to only a few of a certain type, or sometimes 
none at all, so pay close attention. Also note that each level will have its 
own reload time for each ammo type.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the middle if the HUD is your score, which persists throughout the entire 
game. You can increase your score by destroying landers. The point values are 
as follows:
	Lander destroyed by missile   - 50 points
	Lander destroyed by bomb      - 75 points
	Lander destroyed by explosion - 100 points

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Landers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the HUD, to the right of the score, is a Lander symbol followed by a 
number. This indicates the number of landers left for that level. To the 
right of that number are a few horizontal lines (pads). These indicate the 
number of landers that can land before the game is over. Every time a lander 
lands, one of the pads fills up with a lander symbol. When the last pad gets 
filled, the game is over. These reset on every level.

Note that every level can have a different number of landers and pads. Also, 
each level may have a different speed in which the landers descend, so always 
be ready for a fast one!
