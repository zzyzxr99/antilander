Eric bug list
-------------
Edit menu item 'E' does not go to editor

Start - play game to "Supspected End" - lander spawns
"Splash Error" - "ends" again can start again same lander
moves. Can't move mouse 

Start - do nothing - goes to game over - 
lander spawned anyway went down while "Game Over" displayed again.
(There was time elapsed during me starting again)

Start - let game go - ESC to pause. 'Q' does not quit.
Addendum - Start game - ESC 'q' ESC quits

Feature questions

Could not move mouse during any splash. Good?
Question of random spawn landers.
Question of number of spawned landers or landed go to next level or endgame?
